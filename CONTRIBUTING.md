# How to Contribute

Galactipy is a [Cookiecutter][1] template for generating boilerplate files and creating
Python software, especially CLI applications.

We would like to encourage you to contribute to this project and we strive to make it as
easy as possible. This guide is aimed at facilitating onboarding for new collaborators
and serving as the single source of truth for the project's rules and modus
operandi.

Contributions to Galactipy include file manipulation code, tests, tool configuration and
updates, development automation via CI/CD, answering user questions, as well as managing
the backlog of [issues][2] and [Merge Requests][3] through open discussions.

We welcome all contributors willing to work in good faith with other contributors and
the community. No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.

Whether you intend to become a [developer][4] for Galactipy or you are a [user][5] of
the template, following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time
of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they
should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and
features.

[[_TOC_]]

## :runner: TL;DR

Preconditions for contributing as a developer:

- Creating Merge Requests requires a GitLab account;
- Merge Requests should adhere to [GitLab Philosophy][6];
- Commits should adhere to our [commit customs][7];
- The project's [codestyle][8] should be followed strictly;
- Work item management should be done following [our specific practices][9].

### Development Setup

To start contributing to Galactipy, you should start by [forking][10] the upstream
repository to your own GitLab [group][11]. We manage contributions from the community
through the [fork][12] system, which helps us monitor and appreciate continuous input
from individuals and organisations. Contributors who can demonstrate their competence in
further developing Galactipy may be [promoted][13] to upstream Developers or
Maintainers.

After forking the upstream repository, cloning it to your local environment and
accessing the root dir via your IDE or the terminal:

1. Make sure you have Poetry [installed][14];
2. Create and activate your virtual environment:

```sh
poetry env use 3.13 # Or replace with your Python version
eval $(poetry env activate)
```

3. Install the project's dependencies:

```sh
poetry install # Or, preferably, `invoke install` if available
invoke pre-commit-install
```

4. Run the sweeping task with Invoke and check output:

```sh
invoke sweep
```

If everything passes, you're good to go! Otherwise, something is not right and there
might be an opportunity for a [first contribution][15].

## :shrug: Not Sure Where to Start?

If you don't feel ready to start contributing, the following steps should help:

- The project [`README`][16] details how to use Galactipy, provides a high-level
  overview of its features and additional references for project management, many of
  which are applied to our development;
- To effectively contribute to Galactipy, you should probably get knowledgeable about a
  few topics:
  - Understand how Cookiecutter works under the hood for generating projects, especially
    its [advanced usage][17] features;
  - Learn how to use the [Jinja syntax][18] as Cookiecutter uses it to refine control
    over generated template contents;
  - Check the [`pre_gen_project.py`][19] and [`post_gen_project.py`][20] Cookiecutter
    hook files controlling project generation behaviour;
  - Check the [`tests/`][21] directory, which validate all code for pre-gen and post-gen
    hooks;
  - Review the [`.gitlab-ci.yml`][22] file containing Galactipy's [CI jobs][23], which
    outlines the steps for automating project development;
- Take a look at the project's [Milestones][24] page to get familiar with the team's
  plans for future releases;
- When you feel ready to jump into Galactipy development, a good place to start is to
  look for issues labelled with [`seeking-contributors`][25] or
  [`starter-assignment`][26];
- After familiarising yourself
  with the project's [labels][27] and [stages][28],
  you can contribute
  by participating in discussions on issues
  at any of the **Needs** statuses,
  especially those in the [**Needs Triage**][29] stage;
  we are always looking for people
  who help refine issues,
  spot duplicates,
  guide issue authors toward better clarification
  and promote project activity
  through constructive discussions.

If the steps above seem daunting, we can relate! Contributing to an open source project,
whether you are a seasoned developer or perhaps a newcomer aiming to improve your
software skills, [can be scary][30] due to a plethora of reasons. As maintainers, we are
committed to building an environment where every new contributor can thrive, improve
their skills and feel recognised for their contributions.

Should you still feel lost at how to start, these tips might make you more comfortable
with your first steps here:

- **Join the community:** each open source project operates on different principles and
  practices. Coming for the first time is sometimes frightening as you might not be
  familiar with our ways. We approach our development as a continuous [debate][31], and
  we are always open to discussing with different minds in a constructive way. You can
  reach out to us in our [Merge Requests][3] and [Issue Tracker][2] and comment on
  current developments with questions, doubts and suggestions. If still unsure, reach us
  by [e-mail][32] to introduce yourself, we will help you with further orientation;
- **Lurk first:** there is no need to rush things in open source, take your time by
  simply observing repo activity (you can set the option to [watch][33] the repository),
  reading the archives and documentation to soak up the culture before contributing. The
  more time you spend reading and listening, the more likely it is that your
  contribution will be well received;
- **Understand the governance:** read the documentation before contributing. By doing so
  you will know how we make decisions and how these decisions are made for each type of
  contribution. _Reading documentation isn't optional_ when contributing to open source;
- **Start small:** as mentioned above, tackle simple bug or documentation fixes to
  start. It will be easier to learn the process and correct mistakes on a small
  contribution that isn't critical to the project. Make your mistakes on small and less
  significant contributions as you work up to the more complex contributions that
  Galactipy needs. Check [starter assignment][26] issues, or [find your own][34] that
  deserves your time and effort.

>>> [!tip]
Having all that said, aside from actions and tasks you can take to feel more
comfortable contributing, we believe there are three fundamental _behaviours_ that, if
followed, will help you become an even more robust contributor:

1. **Communication makes all the difference:** open source projects often have
   contributors from all over the world, so clear communication is key. It's
   completely okay to ask questions when you're stuck and being clear when submitting
   a Merge Request helps everyone involved. Jumping into discussions don't just
   improve your contributions; it also helps you learn much more from those with more
   experience and improve your problem-solving skills;
2. **Patience is part of the process:** waiting for feedback on Merge Requests,
   learning new tools, and figuring things out all take time. There might be times
   where frustration kicks in and everything feels like taking you nowhere, but if you
   stick to the process and leverage collaboration with other contributors you will
   thrive. _Contributing to open source is a marathon, not a sprint_;
3. **The learning never stops:** contributing to open source is a rewarding
   experience, it will push you to learn new things, show you different perspectives
   and help you become a better communicator. And there's always more to learn,
   getting a chance to grow with every issue, every interaction and every feedback.

## :classical_building: Fundamental Policies

### Code of Conduct

Galactipy has adopted the [Contributor Covenant][35] as its Code of Conduct, and we
expect project participants to adhere to it. Please read the [full document][36] to
understand how to properly communicate with others and know which actions will and will
not be tolerated.

### Open Development

All work on Galactipy happens directly on [GitLab][37], with roadmap and
[milestones][24] being managed via the project's repository. Therefore, a GitLab account
is needed to start contributing.

A [GitHub mirror][38] is set up to facilitate discovery of the template by other users,
but this repository should not be used for active development.

#### Contributor Promotion

Access to the upstream repository is granted at the project owner's discretion, with no
current structured process to evaluate and promote fork contributors. However, we are
open to assign roles to the upstream Galactipy repository to open source developers. A
non-exhaustive list of prerequisites can be found below:

- Contributors will be evaluated by their influence on the project through quality,
  quantity and consistency of their changes;
- Getting owner buy-in through open communication on relevant topics for the project is
  valuable, whether in issue and MR discussions or directly through [e-mail][32]
  contact;
- Follow the formal proposal process and be an advocate of our guidelines, not only
  safeguarding its integrity, but also pushing for improvements where deemed necessary;
- Do the work by effectively delivering the changes proposed for the project, ensuring
  its quality and testing before merging to the `master` branch;
- Do the **other** work, by:
  - [Showing responsibility][39] to document all relevant information promptly, whether
    for internal or external use, to ensure maintenance of our
    [institutional knowledge][40];
  - Upkeeping repository order through our [practices][9];
  - Being an exemplar advocate for a [welcoming community][41];
- Aside from displaying the aforementioned conduct, the contributor must express their
  actual interest in attaining a [role][42] in the upstream repository.

We also recommend interested individuals to follow the guide to the
[_Pragmatic Open Source Contributor_][43], which goes into the attitude for
candidate contributors in more detail.

#### Roadmap Management

Medium and long-term vision for Galactipy
is managed through the project's roadmap,
where the general direction of development
is stored and accessible
for anyone to see and comment.
Issues and Merge Requests should ideally
be related to a milestone
once a work item has been created.

Any contributor can propose a new distinct deliverable
to be added to the roadmap.
A [Merge Request][31] containing the proposal
must be opened with the [**Project Policies** template][44],
detailing nature, scope and purpose of the milestone.

The MR must detail the proposed milestone
added to the [`ROADMAP.md` table][45]
for discussion,
containing:

- **Title:**
  the proposed title for the milestone;
- **Description:**
  an overview of the development,
  in a short summary.
  Details regarding the milestone
  will be discussed in the MR and
  later be included in the official project milestone
  if accepted;
- **Theme:**
  the theme to which
  the proposed milestone is best related to.
  The naming is open to discussion and
  the author is free to suggest it,
  along with an Emoji to
  better convey its nature,
  in a `:emoji: Theme Title` pattern;
- **Timeline:**
  a broad estimation of when this proposed milestone
  can be delivered in full.
  Should act as a starting point for
  the actual work tracking
  to be done via
  the official milestone.

Contributors and maintainers will participate in the discussion to
[refine][46] the scope of the milestone and
either accept of reject the proposal via [thumbs-up/thumbs-down][47] reactions
on the author's initial comment.

Once a milestone has been accepted for inclusion in the roadmap,
it will be officially created in the [Milestones][24] page.
The milestone itself should contain:

- The [Motivational Narrative][48] as a summary to the milestone's goal;
  - We suggest using the following pattern if the actor of the deliverable is not clear:
    `**In order to** {GOAL},<br>**The project will** {ACTION}.`;
- Detailed information collected from the discussion
  regarding nature and scope,
  under the **Reasoning** section;
- A non-exhaustive list of leading developments
  that have been discussed in the MR
  in the **Anticipated Developments** section;
- Details on potential bottleneck mappings
  in the **Caveats** section.

Once the official milestone is created,
it should be attached to the proposal MR and
the `ROADMAP.md` table should be updated
with the actual link to the milestone
before merging to `master`.

>>> [!tip]
Milestones should be the entry door for new contributors
to have a general glimpse on
what the project has been prioritising and
where it wants to go,
helping newcomers get onboarded more quickly.
Therefore, contributors writing official milestones
should approach the task with the following goals in mind:

- [_Comprehensive, yet succinct_][49];
- [_Standardised, yet conscious_][50].
>>>

After a milestone has been completed,
a new Merge Request should be opened to
update the `ROADMAP.md` table in the **Timeline** field
with the following possible values:

- `**Delivered with <version> :airplane_departure:**`,
  if properly associated to a [GitLab Release][51];
- `**Delivered Internally :100:**`,
  if the milestone has no impact on project releases.

Likewise,
the MRs should be associated with
the completed milestone.

#### Work Item Tracking

Galactipy development is iterative
and structured preferably around [Merge Requests][31].
Whenever project advancements are not immediately deliverable,
progress is tracked through GitLab Issues and Tasks.
Use cases for this type of work item include:

- User requests
  (since general users are not allowed to create MRs);
- Larger scoped developments
  which are unable to be delivered
  in a single MR;
- Ideas for future developments
  which can't be prioritised
  due to scope or team capacity.

To effectively manage
issue and task lifecycles,
we use [GitLab Statuses][65].
Our approach to this feature
relies on
keeping few options for
in-progress and completed items
and providing different options
for other stages of the lifecycle.
This allows project members to
better relay [context][46]
surrounding those items,
instead of only stating
their condition.

By combining effective
status and label assignments,
both users and the development team
can locate discussions
more easily,
streamlining communication
and making development more agile.

The following statuses
have been implemented for the project,
with contributors expected to
understand
each use case and
when to move from one stage to another:

| Status | Status Category | Description |
|:-------|:---------------:|:------------|
| ![Triage icon][52] **Needs Triage** | Triage | Initial stage for [User requests][66], which require a first analysis by a Galactipy contributor before work on its scope is either accepted or declined. It is also the default open state for new items if not overriden. |
| ![Refinement icon][53] **Needs Refinement** | Triage | Describes more general ideas that might receive development at some point, but whose current state does not detail implementation or paths to delivery. Lacking scope, represents more of a desire than an actual proposal – which might actually prove unfeasible later. Should be used to inform the need for further discussions before being cleared for development. |
| ![Criteria icon][54] **Needs Criteria** | Triage | This describes items whose scope is set, but acceptance criteria is still pending to be added before being cleared for development. In contrast with the **Needs Refinement** status, in this stage the deliverable is known and understood, but is waiting for a contributor to detail in smaller steps. |
| ![Steps icon][55] **Needs Delivery Steps** | Triage | A specific type of triaging item, signaling pending work before the item can be cleared as a [starter assignment][56] development. In contrast with the **Needs Criteria**, this stage indicates the work item will be processed with greater detail than usual so a new contributor can pick it up and develop it with little to no friction. |
| ![Decomposition icon][57] **Needs Decomposition** | Triage | Proposals or requests that have been deemed too large in scope to be considered a single work item and must be broken down in two or more items before proceeding. |
| ![Greenlit icon][58] **Greenlit** | To Do | Items that have been cleared for development after having their scope and acceptance criteria properly defined. |
| ![Pipeline icon][59] **Pipeline** | To Do | Items that have scope and acceptance criteria, but that address a specific development stream which is not currently considered the most valuable for delivery. Can be picked for development, but should be left out in favour of **Greenlit** and **Priority** items. |
| ![Priority icon][60] **Priority** | To Do | Signals items which take priority over other cleared work items. Should be used with discretion and only in cases where lack of action can lead to significant issues to security or user experience. |
| ![Progress icon][61] **In Progress** | In Progress | Items currently being actively worked on. |
| ![Done icon][62] **Done** | Done | Items delivered in full. |
| ![Canceled icon][63] **Out of Scope** | Canceled | Items deemed out of the scope of Galactipy. |
| ![Canceled icon][63] **Cannot Implement** | Canceled | Items which are unable to be delivered by the development team in its original form, due to technical barriers or security risks. |
| ![Canceled icon][63] **Not Feasible** | Canceled | Items which can technically be delivered, but that have been declined for development due to any other factor outside the other **Canceled** stage items. |
| ![Duplicate icon][64] **Duplicate** | Canceled | Items marked as duplicates of previous work items. |

#### GitLab Practices

##### Issue Titles Should be Framed in Imperative Mood

Issue titles should be clear to allow anyone visiting the Issue Tracker to understand
the scope of development, and get more detail by opening the issue page if one picks
their interest. Thus, issue titles should use imperative, just like [commits][67].

Using the imperative mood for issue titles is recommended because it clearly states the
action or goal of the issue as a command or instruction, making it easier to understand
what needs to be **done**, explicitly describing the task to be accomplished, rather
than just naming a topic or describing past actions. The title of an issue should always
summarise the _what_ that specific issue is trying to address.

>>> [!caution]
The only exception to using imperative mood in issue titles is when it refers to a bug
or malfunction that has been identified. In this case, the title should refer to the
erroneous **behaviour** of Galactipy.

Since when bugs first appear, its solution is unknown, by providing the behaviour
being observed we can equally understand _what_ needs to be addressed to close the
issue.
>>>

##### Tasks Are Used as Acceptance Criteria for Issues

[Tasks][68] are a specific type of work item
in GitLab
which can be associated
with issues as their child items.
In Galactipy development,
Merge Requests are
the [default][31] form of actionable development,
while issues are used
for compiling user requests
and development intentions
that can not be directly delivered
through an open Merge Request.

In either case,
Tasks must be used
to complement the open issue
with their acceptance criteria
to be closed.
Their titles should follow
the same [rules][69] as issue titles,
while descriptions are optional
if relevant to understand implementation.

>>> [!caution]
The only label allowed on tasks
is `manual-closure`.
Otherwise,
there should be no labels
associated with a task.
>>>

##### Usage of the `seeking-contributors` Labels

`seeking-contributors` is the label used
to indicate work items
whose authors need help from the community
in further advancing with development.

The `opinion` label marks work items which
are at a [**Triage**][28] stage
and whose discussion has stalled.
It signals other contributors and the community
that more people are requested
to provide opinion on the matter,
as a consensus for its final scope
has not been reached yet.

The `delivery` label,
on the other hand,
is used to mark items
at the **To Do** stage
that can be picked up for development
if a contributor is interested
in delivering the solution.
It is similar in this manner
to the `starter-assignment` labels,
with the difference that `seeking-contributors::delivery` is aimed
towards contributors
with intermediate experience in the project.

>>> [!important]
Contributors planning on refining an issue or Merge Request to mark with the
`seeking-contributors::delivery` label should be aware of the **Goldilocks Priority**
principle: the item's priority should not be so high that a core contributor should do
it, but not too low that it isn't useful enough for a core contributor to spend time
reviewing it, answering questions, helping get it into a release etc.
>>>

##### Blocks Must be Set at the Same Issue Level

[Issue blocks][70] are not mandatory for development, but marking block relations
between work items is encouraged when they are clear for the issue author, but might not
be for someone else. This helps reinforce an orderly development and improve the
environment for newcomers and veterans alike.

However, block relations must only be placed between working items of the same type:
issues can only block **issues**, tasks can only block **tasks**.

##### Tasks Should Have no Milestones

Given GitLab Tasks are used for acceptance criteria of issues, breaking a deliverable
down to smaller components, we prefer to keep only issues and MRs associated with
milestones. This reduces clutter in the milestone board.

However, given the [default behaviour][71] of GitLab, tasks associated with milestones
can accumulate over time. The association should be removed by [being queried][72] in
the Issue Tracker and edited through the "Bulk edit" option.

### Versioning Customs

As a Cookiecutter template, users rely on Galactipy only once in their project's entire
lifecycle: at its creation. From the user's perspective, differences between Galactipy
versions are only minor and the project itself is always in a stable configuration.

From this view, Galactipy is not a dynamic library that demands continuous maintenance
to prevent downstream application issues but rather a pre-configured package providing
essential files and configurations for rapid project initiation.

Galactipy’s versioning should be seen as reflecting the progression of our efforts over
time. Given the absence of breaking changes, we choose to adhere to
[Intended Effort Versioning][73] for consistency.

We approach our versions with the following pattern:

- Version `v1.0.0` can only be set once all requirements specified in the %7 milestone
  are satisfied;
- Versions can only be tagged if altering end-user generated projects; changes to
  project internals only do not qualify for tagging;
- Update **MICRO** versions when:
  - Bugs that prevent the template from being properly generated are fixed;
  - Typos are fixed;
  - Configuration files are updated with the latest reference syntax without altering
    their behaviour;
  - Markdown files are modified;
- Update **MESO** versions when:
  - Project generation behaviour is modified without modifications to
    `cookiecutter.json` prompt;
  - Configuration files behaviour is modified;
  - Code files are added, removed or updated;
- Update **MACRO** versions when:
  - Available options for a step in `cookiecutter.json` are altered;
  - Steps are either added or removed from `cookiecutter.json`;
  - The type of a step is altered in `cookiecutter.json`.

### Branch Organization

We apply the [GitLab Philosophy][6] for conducting new development, which means that all
changes revolve around open Merge Requests, and Merge Requests are the central space for
discussing design, implementation and monitoring development health with
[CI pipelines][74].

Creation of new branches without subsequent attachment to a new MR is strongly
discouraged. If the work is still in progress but needs to be uploaded to the
repository, name the branch with the `test-` prefix so the CI will ignore it.

#### Branch Naming Standards

While standard branch naming
is not strictly required,
we offer some suggestions
to enhance communication
during Merge Request reviews:

- Use the [imperative mood][69]
  with concise language
  for your branch names;
  this helps reviewers
  quickly gain insight
  into the changes
  your branch applies;
- For small changes,
  consider naming the branch
  with either the `flash-` or `fl-` prefixes
  to inform reviewers
  of their nature.

>>> [!note]
Flash branches are not the same
as `quick-win` labelled issues:

- **`quick-win` issues**
  mark planned developments
  that are easy to deliver
  and are used
  to trach such initiatives;
- **Flash branches**
  indicate changes
  that are intended
  to be created
  and merged quickly,
  often representing unplanned work
  that doesn't require an associated issue
  or extensive Merge Request details.

While flash branches can sometimes
be linked to `quick-win` issues,
they primarily serve
as a signal
for short-lived changes
without the need
for prior planning
or detailed documentation.
>>>

### Commit Customs

#### Gitmoji

Galactipy uses [Gitmoji][75] to characterise the nature of each commit, you should
familiarise yourself with this method by looking at the list of possible Emoji to be
used. Additionally, looking at past commits and which files they modified is also a good
way to understand how Gitmoji should be applied to the project.

Some times a commit can encompass more than one Gitmoji, as changes to a file related to
a domain can only be applied without breaking the project by also changing other files.
In this case, prefer to classify the commit through the most fundamental change (i.e.,
the change that led to subsequent file changes from other domains).

>>> [!warning]
The shorthand codes specified in the Gitmoji website use the GitHub standard. For some
of the Gitmoji, these shorthands are different when rendering in GitLab, be aware of
which ones:

| Gitmoji | Default Shorthand | Shorthand in GitLab |
|:-------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| :brick: | `:bricks:` | `:brick:` |
| :construction_site: | `:building_construction:` | `:construction_site:` |
| :camera_with_flash: | `:camera_flash:` | `:camera_with_flash:` |
| :card_box: | `:card_file_box:` | `:card_box:` |
| :goal: | `:goal_net:` | `:goal:` |
| :pencil: | `:memo:` | `:pencil:` |
| :face_with_monocle: | `:monocle_face:` | `:face_with_monocle:` |
>>>

If the changes still reflect a work in progress that will be rebased at a later moment,
we recommend committing with the `:construction:` Gitmoji so the CI will ignore it.

#### Commit Message Structure

Commit messages should be clear and concise, and detailing aspects of the commit through
its body is strongly encouraged, as it helps developers to later understand
implementation and reasoning behind changes. The article
[_How to Write a Git Commit Message_][76] is a valuable resource and reading through it
is strongly recommended before contributing, as developers are expected to apply those
principles when committing.

#### Git Trailers

Every commit should also be identified with the respective [Git trailer][77] to
categorise the type of change being made. When a new version of Galactipy is released
through a tag, a CI pipeline compiles every trailer to automate the version's release
and update the `CHANGELOG` file in the root directory.

The available trailers are listed below and defined in the [`changelog-config.yml`][78]
file:

|  Git trailer  |       Category in CHANGELOG        | Use Cases |
| :---------------: | :------------------------------------: |----|
| `enhancement`        |           :milky_way: Components            | Updates in behaviour and functionality to existing features for end users. |
| `feature`        |           :milky_way: Components            | Introduction of new features, tools and integrations for end users. |
| `bug` |      :wrench: Fixes & Refactoring      | Correction of bugs introduced in previous releases that went unnoticed. |
| `refactoring` |      :wrench: Fixes & Refactoring      | Modifications to the code without changing its output. |
| `bugfix` |      :wrench: Fixes & Refactoring      | Correction of bugs introduced in feature branches and identified before they are merged. |
| `fix` |      :wrench: Fixes & Refactoring      | Minor corrections that can not be characterised as bugs in and of themselves, such as typos and naming conventions. |
| `ci` |     :package: Build System & CI/CD     | Changes to Galactipy's GitLab CI file. |
| `testing`        |     :package: Build System & CI/CD     | Changes to tests for Galactipy. |
|      `hooks`      |            :gear: Internals            | Modifications made to pre-gen and post-gen hooks. |
| `project-config`  |            :gear: Internals            | Modifications made to configuration files for the project, excluding those specified in the `policies` trailer. |
| `build`        |     :construction_site: Template Internals     | Modifications to CI workflows for generated projects. |
| `template-config` | :construction_site: Template Internals | Modifications made to configuration files for generated projects, inside `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}`. |
|  `documentation`  |          :pencil: Documentation          | Changes to documentation, either in Galactipy's or the template's `README` file. |
|  `policies`  |          :scroll: Project Policies          | Modifications to official project policies in `LICENCE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.triage-policies.yml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, files under `.gitlab` and all `tool` sections in `pyproject.toml` except for `tool.poetry`. |
|  `milestones`  |          :scroll: Project Policies          | Milestone updates in `ROADMAP.md`. |
|  `dependencies`   |    :arrow_up: Dependency Updates     | Dependency updates, for either Galactipy itself or the template. |

### Styling

#### Codestyle

The project uses [Ruff][79] for formatting and codestyle. Developers can check both the
linter and the formatter with the preconfigured tasks with `invoke codestyle` and
`invoke check-linter` commands.

Given the boilerplate code used by Cookiecutter, the formatter ignores all files under
the `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}` directory, as running Ruff otherwise will cause it to
crash. When modifying code within this directory, developers are expected to validate
their codestyle in line with Ruff by manually generating projects before submitting
changes for approval through the Merge Request.

#### Semantic Line Breaks

When editing Markdown files, [Semantic Line Breaks][80] should be applied. This
increases the document's readability by other contributors and makes changes clearer
when using `git diff`. This comes from Brian Kernighan in his 1974 book
_"UNIX for Beginners"_:

>>> [!note] Hints for Preparing Documents
Most documents go through several versions (always more than you expected) before they
are finally finished. Accordingly, you should do whatever possible to make the job of
changing them easy.

First, when you do the purely mechanical operations of typing, type so subsequent
editing will be easy. Start each sentence on a new line. Make lines short, and break
lines at natural places, such as after commas and semicolons, rather than randomly.
Since most people change documents by rewriting phrases and adding, deleting and
rearranging sentences, these precautions simplify any editing you have to do later.

On a more practical level, this [article][81] from Derek Sivers provides additional
reasons for adopting this style.

The only files that should not follow this rule are issue and Merge Request templates
inside [`.gitlab`][82] and [`CHANGELOG.md`][83].

### Checks & Hooks

Developers are encouraged to run local tests, check codestyle and static typing with the
`invoke sweep` command before committing.

Pre-commit hooks are configured to block updates not following the rules:

- All files must comply the [POSIX][84] standard;
- Pre and post-gen hook files must comply with the Ruff linter.

Ensure both Invoke and Pre-Commit are [installed][85] in your virtual environment.

### Continuous Integration

Besides being hosted in GitLab, Galactipy uses [GitLab CI][86] to automate the following
development streams:

- Testing;
- Test coverage reporting;
- Code quality analysis;
- Releases;
- GitHub mirror branch updates.

For releases and mirror branch updates, a [bot user][87] is used for authoring changes
through the CI/CD group variable `$GALACTIPY_BOT_API_TOKEN`.

Merge Requests can not be completed unless its CI pipeline passes. The project's CI
configuration runs under more strict rules and no jobs are allowed to fail. This
includes the external job provided by [Codacy][88], which is used for code quality
assurance. Take a look at the [Pull Requests][89] page for Galactipy for further
information on reasons why a PR Quality Review job might have failed.

Developers should be familiar with the [GitLab CI syntax][90] to effectively contribute
with further automation of the development cycle.

### Licence

By contributing to Galactipy, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under
the [MIT Licence][91].

## :book: Our Philosophy

This document is more than just a technical guide on how to contribute; it defines the
deeper principles we follow to shape our approach to Galactipy development. This section
outlines our _modus operandi_ and provides insight into the mindset needed for
successful contributions.

Our project's guidelines are strongly influenced by the [GitLab Handbook][92], which
serves as GitLab's official company manual. Their best practices are transferable to any
team, and we have adopted several of these principles to formalise expectations for
contributors within our development ecosystem.

### Start with a Merge Request

> Adapted from the [Communication][93] section of the GitLab Handbook.

When possible, it's best practice to start a discussion with a Merge Request (MR)
instead of an issue. An MR is associated with a specific change that is proposed and
transparent for everyone to review and openly discuss.

The nature of MRs facilitate discussions around a proposed solution to a problem that is
actionable. An MR is actionable, while an issue will take longer to take action on.

1. **Always** open an MR for things you are suggesting and/or proposing. Whether
   something is not working right or we are iterating on a new internal process, it is
   worth opening a Merge Request with the minimal valuable change instead of opening an
   issue encouraging open feedback on the problem without proposing any specific change
   directly. Remember, an MR also invites discussion, but it's specific to the proposed
   change which facilitates focused decision;
2. Never ask someone to create an issue when they can default to the Merge Request;
3. Not every solution will solve the problem at hand. Keep discussions focused by
   **defining the problem first** and **explaining your rationale** behind the Minimal
   Valuable Change (MVC) proposed in the MR;
4. Have a [**bias for action**][39] and do not aim for consensus. Every MR is as-is
   proposal, if an MR's author isn't responsive take ownership of it and complete it.
   Some improvement is better than none;
5. If submitting a change for a feature,
   **update the description with the final conclusions** – why an MR was rejected or
   why it was approved. This makes it much easier to see the current state of an issue
   for everyone involved in the implementation and prevents confusion and discussion
   later on;
6. Submit the **smallest** viable and valuable thing. When proposing a change, submit
   the smallest reasonable commit, put suggestions for other enhancements in separate
   issues/MRs and link them. An MR can start off as only a problem description and
   `TODO` comments;
7. Do not leave MRs open for a long time. MRs should be **actionable** – maintainers
   should have a clear understanding of what changed and what they are ultimately
   approving or rejecting;
8. When submitting a MVC, **ask for feedback** from your peers. If they suggest changes,
   you get the opportunity to improve your work and propose an alternative solution.
   This promotes collaboration and advances everyone's skills;
9. Respond to comments within a **threaded discussion**. If there isn't a discussion
   thread yet, you can use the Reply to Comment button from the comments to create one.
   This will prevent comments from containing many interweaved discussions with
   responses that are hard to follow;
10. If your comment or answer contains separate topics, write separate comments for
    each, so others can address topics independently using the Reply to comment button;
11. If you have received any feedback or questions on your MR, try to acknowledge
    comments as that's how we ensure we create an environment of belonging for all team
    members. Merging your MR as-is without giving an answer or any response makes the
    commenters feel their opinions are unheard. On the other hand, having a MR with too
    many comments may risk the author falling into a perpetual loop of changing the MR
    description or explaining too much, causing people to defer rather than working with
    a bias for action. This is something we want to avoid. When fast decisions are
    needed, we'll have to accept that people listened to us but don't owe us an
    explanation to have fast decisions based on everyone's input. The goals are to be
    transparent and collaborative – not to lose efficiency. Not everyone will agree, but
    we expect all people to disagree, commit, and disagree;
12. Even when something is not done, share it internally so people can comment early and
    prevent rework;
13. Create a **Draft** Merge Request to prevent an accidental early merge. Only use
    Draft when merging it would **make things worse**, which should rarely be the case
    when contributing to the handbook. Most merge requests that are in progress don't
    make things worse. In this case, do not use Draft; if someone merges it earlier than
    you expected just create a new Merge Request for additional items. Never ask someone
    to do a final review or merge something that still has Draft status. At that point
    you should be convinced it is good enough to go out;
14. If any follow-up actions are required on the issue after the Merge Request is
    merged, avoid auto-closing the related issue.

### _Say Why, Not Just What_

> Adapted from the [GitLab Values][94].

Transparent changes have the reasons for the change laid out clearly along with the
change itself. This leads to fewer questions later on because people already have some
understanding. A change with no public explanation can lead to a lot of extra rounds of
questioning, which is less efficient.

This also helps with institutional memory: a year from now when you want to know why a
decision was made, or not, the issue or MR that has the decision also shares why the
decision was made. This is related to [Chesterton's fence][95] – it's much easier to
suggest removing or changing something if you know why it exists in the first place.

If you use generalized terms such as "industry standard" or "best practices", be sure to
give context, as without context they can be seen as potentially vague or opaque.

Saying why and not just what enables discussion around topics that may impact more than
one front. When decisions align with more than a single project goal, they are easy to
discuss and decide. When there are multiple goals involved for a change, directly
discussing the trade-offs is easier with more context.

Articulating why also helps people understand how something changed when you articulate
that you changed your mind.

Saying why does not mean justifying a decision against all other suggestions. The
maintainers are responsible for their decision. The maintainers are not responsible for
convincing other people, but they should be able to articulate their reasoning for the
change.

When a contributor comes across a milestone, MR or issue that does not provide a "why"
with sufficient context, the team member is responsible for getting the why and, if
needed, working with the maintainers to ensure that it is adequately documented and
communicated to give context to other team members. In the absence of a why, team
members may speculate the why. This is something that can lead to disruption and
inefficiency.

### Operate with a Bias for Action

> Adapted from the [GitLab Values][96].

It's important that we keep our focus on action, and don't fall into the trap of
analysis paralysis or sticking to a slow, quiet path without risk. Decisions should be
thoughtful, but delivering fast results requires the fearless acceptance of occasionally
making mistakes; our bias for action also allows us to course correct quickly. Try to
get results as fast as possible, but without compromising consistency, quality or
jostling our general practices when working together.

### Interactions Enable Insights

At Galactipy, we approach every single interaction – with other contributors, users, the
codebase, the configuration files and documentation – as a stimulant to keep our minds
acute, allowing us to tie elements previously unnoticed that echo through the project.

Interact with elements of the project with an observant spirit, there is always an
unseen factor. Capture insights and reflect upon their meaning and implications for the
project and your work. Software development is human at its core, and
[**human systems are inherently complex**][97]. We should not let all the code,
interfaces and systems we handle on our work obscure the fact that we pursue building a
template so it can be useful and cherished by others.

### Sharing Insights Drives Progress

By extracting the root of those four values, we have conceived a fifth value of our own
to steer our development philosophy. This principle is fundamental to how we approach
collaboration, documentation, and community engagement. It emphasizes the importance of
actively sharing knowledge, experiences, and ideas to foster a culture keen to
exercising **continuous improvement**. By embracing this value, we aim to create an
environment where both contributors and users feel empowered to learn, cooperate and
grow together.

In practical terms, this means that we prioritise clear and concise documentation of
knowledge, ensuring that relevant information is easily accessible to all interested
parties. This includes maintaining up-to-date guides, tutorials and reference materials
that reflect the current state of the project; articulating thought processes, design
decisions and problem-solving strategies in issue and Merge Request discussions;
providing the adequate guidance for new contributors to succeed in their first
development; storing ideas generated from discussions into work items for future
prioritisation.

By doing so, we facilitate a deeper understanding of the project's internals and
evolution, making it easier for new contributors to get started and for users to
understand how to make the most out of our project. This also reinforces that
recognising even small efforts, such as adding a link to a useful resource or explaining
a complex concept in simpler terms, can significantly impact the value of the project to
someone else.

### There Are no Good First Issues

The concept of labelling issues in open source projects to mark potential good
contributions for a first timer has its origins in the [First Timers Only][98]
initiative by Kent C. Dodds.

At Galactipy, we tackle the notion of Good First Issues in a different way. We believe
that enabling development from new contributors is an integral part of keeping an open
source project active, but it takes more than a label in an issue tracker to succeed.
The notion that people can just browse repositories and search for a contribution is
invalid, most of what is labelled needs more context for any one new contributor to
approach it. This is represented by our philosophy:

<div align="center">

_The best good first issues are the ones you open yourself._

</div>

- For **upstream developers**, this means understanding that not all developments mapped
  by you should be _delivered_ by you. If the change in question can be considered
  relevant for introducing a new contributor to the project, time should be dedicated in
  ensuring the change _can_ be delivered by them, through work item refinement and clear
  steps to conclude the demand, instead of being delivered without ever granting an
  opportunity for someone – and the community – to grow. This also means being available
  to [orient][41] contributors should they feel lost and reassure
  [clear communication][99] with them;
- For **Galactipy users** who have opened a request on the Issue Tracker, this means
  that the best solution to your request is to deliver it yourself! By approaching
  your requests as gateway to contributing to the project, you generate growth
  opportunities to yourself and the team. If upon opening your request you feel inclined
  to come forward and help resolve it yourself, mark it with the appropriate label by
  adding `/label ~"up-for-a-change"` to the request description so that a developer
  can mentor you on the solution.

## :speaking_head: Proposing Changes as a Developer

Galactipy is a Cookiecutter template, used for generating files within a directory
structure based on the parameters provided by the user. Therefore, the project's main
consumption of time is related to how these files are configured, as opposed to writing
additional code.

Code maintenance within Galactipy itself encompasses:

- Hooks for Cookiecutter (code that is executed before and after file generation):
  - [`pre_gen_project.py`][19] is used to validate parameter inputs from the user;
  - [`post_gen_project.py`][20] is used to ensure the project is generated with the
    correct files and content;
- [Tests][21] for the functions defined in pre-gen and post-gen hooks;
- [Tasks][100] aimed at improving and speeding up local development with [Invoke][101].

Outside this narrow set of contributions, most of the development team's time will
involve:

- Ensuring projects generated with Galactipy and their featured tools can be used from
  the very beginning;
- Keeping tools and integrations updated and working with generated projects, with
  constant revision of configuration files, workflows and behaviour;
- Researching and implementing new tools and integrations;
- Keeping the documentation up to date; this encompasses:
  - The [`README`][16] file, which lists all features provided by Galactipy, basic
    instructions on setup and usage, as well as further reading recommendations for
    additional Python libraries and guides on project management best practices;
  - URLs linking to the repository and configuration guide for each tool provided with
    generated project as inline comments for their respective configuration sections;
  - Comment markers to guide users on additional configuration that might be needed for
    proper functioning of generated projects; see [this section][102] for further
    information.

### Preparing to Contribute

#### Choosing What to Contribute

Everyone benefits if contributors focus on changes that are useful, clear, easy to
evaluate, and already pass basic checks.

Sometimes, a contributor will already have a particular new change or fix in mind. If
seeking ideas, consult the list of [starter assignments][26].

Before proceeding, contributors should evaluate if the proposed change is likely to be
relevant, new and actionable:

- Is it clear that code or configuration files must change? Proposing a Merge Request is
  appropriate only when a clear problem or beneficial change has been identified. If
  simply having trouble using Galactipy, go through the [`README`][16] file and links
  directing to support content first, rather than consider filing an issue or proposing
  an MR. When in doubt, email [`mpq.dev@pm.me`][32] first about the possible change;
- Search the [Issue Tracker][2] and [past Merge Requests][3] for related discussions.
  Often, the problem has been discussed before, with a resolution that doesn't require a
  code or configuration change, or recording what kinds of changes will not be accepted
  as a resolution;
- Otherwise, if a logically similar issue or MR already exists, then contribute to the
  discussion first, instead of creating a new one;
- Is the scope of the change matched to the contributor's level of experience? Anyone is
  qualified to suggest a typo fix, but refactoring core scheduling logic requires much
  more understanding of the underlying tool/code. Some changes require building up
  experience first.

It's worth emphasizing that changes to startup options available for users in Galactipy
are more complex to implement as it requires a potential overhaul of configuration
files. They will be subjected to more scrutiny, and held to a higher standard of review
than changes to less fundamental building blocks.

#### Opening Admissible Merge Requests

For developers and maintainers, changes should not be approached in a reactive way as
demands, but as a proactive **proposals**. If you are contributing in the Galactipy
repository, you are expected to always act on and provide proposals to improve the state
of the project. This distinguishes developers from Galactipy users who, unfamiliar with
the codebase and project configuration, are only able to _request_ changes through the
Issue Tracker.

To work under a proactive proposal mindset, we always [start with a Merge Request][31].

It is best to follow these best practices when proposing changes:

- **Always** use one of the [Merge Request templates][103], applying the proper type to
  the change being proposed. Each template contains a brief summary detailing under
  which circumstances it is best employed. This helps coordinate discussions with the
  rest of the team and facilitates the reviewer's work;
- If the change is non-trivial, we encourage you to start a discussion with a maintainer
  or another member of the team. You can do this by tagging them in an MR before
  submitting the code for review. Talking to team members can be helpful when making
  design decisions. Communicating the [intent][46] behind your changes can also help
  expedite Merge Request reviews;
- Follow our [commit customs][7], as consistent commit messages that follow these
  guidelines make the history more readable.

Also equally important is the notion to **keep MRs simple**, with the amount of changes
in a single MR as small as possible. If you want to contribute a large feature, think
very carefully about what the minimum valuable change is. Can you split the
functionality into two smaller MRs? Can you submit only a fraction of the code? Can you
start with a very simple proof-of-concept? Can you do just a part of the refactor?

<div align="center">

_Live by smaller iterations._

</div>

Small MRs which are more easily reviewed lead to higher code quality, which is more
important to Galactipy than having a minimal commit log. The smaller an MR is, the more
likely it will be merged quickly. After that you can send more MRs to enhance and expand
the feature. The [How to Get Faster PR Reviews][104] guide from the Kubernetes team also
has some great points regarding this.

#### Review Criteria

Before considering how to contribute, it's useful to understand how contributions are
reviewed, and why changes may be rejected. See the detailed [guide][105] for code
reviewers from Google's Engineering Practices documentation. Simply put, changes that
have many or large positives, and few negative effects or risks, are much more likely to
be merged, and merged quickly. Risky and less valuable changes are very unlikely to be
merged, and may be rejected outright rather than receive iterations of review.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of traits a contribution might have that either enhances
or hinders its probability of being merged:

- **Positives:**
  - Fixes the root cause of a bug in existing functionality;
  - Adds functionality or fixes a problem needed by a large number of users;
  - Simple, targeted;
  - Maintains or improves template consistency;
  - Easily tested; has tests;
  - Reduces complexity and lines of code and configuration;
  - Change has already been discussed and is known to committers;
- **Negatives, risks:**
  - Band-aids a symptom of a bug only without addressing its root cause;
  - Introduces complex new functionality, especially an API that needs to be supported;
  - Adds complexity that only helps a niche use case;
  - Changes a public API or semantics (rarely allowed);
  - Adds large dependencies;
  - Changes versions of existing dependencies without proper testing;
  - Adds a large amount of code;
  - Makes lots of modifications in one "big bang" change.

### Development Workflow

After cloning Galactipy and following the [development setup][85], run `invoke test` (an
isolated Pytest task) and if no errors are raised, then run `invoke sweep` (the whole
set of development checks in a single task). This step is crucial to ensure you don't
introduce any regressions as you work on your change.

>>> [!note]
The project uses `pytest-cookies` as a development dependency. This plugin allows
Pytest to validate if the current state of the code and configuration files allows for
a project to be generated without errors. While it acts as a handy tool to ensure that
critical errors will be caught by [`test_bake_project`][106], the reality is that
developers should be aware of limitations currently faced by the project to implement
end-to-end tests, as its nature relates less to code and more to behaviour after file
generation.

The %1 milestone has been created to address this situation at a future moment. Feel
free to take a look at it and discuss with the maintainers if you wish to contribute
to this development front.
>>>

As Galactipy's purpose is to generate functional repositories which can be used by
developers with minimal configuration, the nature of development involves ensuring not
only the project itself is generated, but that generated projects are functional.

As a developer, please be conscious of crucial steps to validate before submitting your
changes, and understand many of them require manual action outside the Galactipy
repository.

A non-exhaustive list of steps to consider:

- Did you add or modify unit tests if development involved changes to pre and post-gen
  hooks?
- Are all checks passing with `invoke sweep`?
- Did you address all issues raised by Codacy for the Merge Request branch in question?
- Compress the Galactipy repository in a ZIP file and use it to generate a project.
  After installing dependencies and setting up its virtual environment, test proper
  behaviour for the following:
  - Can the project be called from the CLI if the `bare_repo` option used was `False`?
  - Do tests for the generated project pass if the `bare_repo` option used was `False`?
  - Are files rendered correctly? Are there any missing files?
  - Are files rendered without excessive blank lines or lack thereof due to Jinja
    [whitespace control][107]?
  - After setting up required external configuration identified the `UPDATEME` tags,
    does the project CI pass after pushing a semantic version tag to its temporary repo?
  - Have the changes for a specific configuration file being altered been applied and
    are behaving as expected?

#### Feature Flags

Sometimes,
a feature is too large
to be delivered in one Merge Request,
requiring progress to be done iteratively.
To prevent the need for large changes,
contributors can specify files and directories
to be removed from project generation
by appending `_feature` to their names.
They can use this configuration
to create new files and directories
or duplicate existing ones
and work in smaller steps
until the feature is ready to be shipped to users.

Additionally,
by setting the hidden Cookiecutter variable `__debug` to `true`,
developers can render projects including the `_feature` files and directories,
in case they need to check output.

### Merge Request Review Process

After [starting with a Merge Request][31], ensuring you have opened an
[admissible MR][108] and have finished contributing with changes, the review process can
start.

#### Contribution Acceptance Criteria

To make sure that your Merge Request can be approved, ensure that it meets the
contribution acceptance criteria below:

1. The change is as small as possible;
2. If the Merge Request contains more than 500 changes:
   - Explain the reason;
   - Mention a maintainer;
3. Mention any major breaking changes;
4. Include proper tests and make all tests pass (unless it contains a test exposing a
   bug in existing code);
   - If a failing CI build seems to be unrelated to your contribution, you can try
     restarting the failing CI job, rebasing on top of the target branch to bring in
     updates that may resolve the failure, or if it has not been fixed yet, ask a
     developer to help you fix the test;
5. The MR contains a few logically organized commits, using [Gitmoji][109]. We do not
   apply the squash method for merging changes;
6. The changes can merge without problems. If not, you should rebase if you're the only
   one working on your feature branch, otherwise merge the default branch into the MR
   branch;
7. Only one specific issue is fixed or one specific feature is implemented. Do not
   combine things; send separate Merge Requests for each issue or feature;
8. Contains functionality that other users will benefit from;
9. Changes do not degrade performance;
10. If the Merge Request adds any new libraries, they should conform to our existing
    licence; Also, make the reviewer aware of the new library and explain why you need
    it.

#### Getting Reviewed

As soon as you have changes to review, have the changes reviewed by a reviewer. The
reviewer can:

- Give you a second opinion on the chosen solution and implementation;
- Help look for bugs, logic problems, or uncovered edge cases.

If the Merge Request is small and straightforward to review, you can skip the reviewer
step and directly ask a maintainer.

What constitutes "small and straightforward" is a gray area. Here are some examples of
small and straightforward changes:

- Fixing a typo or making small copy changes;
- A tiny refactor that doesn't change any behaviour or data;
- Removing unused functions, classes and methods;
- A well-understood logic change that requires changes to 5 lines of code or less.

Otherwise, a Merge Request should be first reviewed by a reviewer in each domain (e.g.,
CI, GitHub features, GitLab features etc.) the MR touches, as maintainers may not have
the relevant domain knowledge. This also helps to spread the workload.

Depending on the areas your Merge Request touches, it must be approved by one or more
maintainers.

Getting your Merge Request merged also requires a maintainer. If it requires more than
one approval, the last maintainer to review and approve merges it.

### Roles and Attributions

#### The Responsibility of the Merge Request Author

The responsibility to find the best solution and implement it lies with the Merge
Request author. The author stays assigned to the Merge Request as the assignee
throughout the code review lifecycle. If you are unable to set yourself as an assignee,
ask a reviewer to do this for you.

Before requesting a review from a maintainer to approve and merge, they should be
confident that:

- It actually solves the problem it was meant to solve;
- It does so in the most appropriate way;
- It satisfies all requirements;
- There are no remaining bugs, logical problems, uncovered edge cases, or known
  vulnerabilities.

The best way to do this, and to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth with reviewers, is to
perform a self-review of your own Merge Request, following the [Code Review][110]
guidelines. During this self-review, try to include comments in the MR on lines where
decisions or trade-offs were made, or where a contextual explanation might aid the
reviewer in more easily understanding the code.

To reach the required level of confidence in their solution, an author is expected to
involve other people in the investigation and implementation processes as appropriate,
with the goal of:

- Discussing different solutions or getting an implementation reviewed;
- Getting an in-depth review of the solution;
- Clearing up confusion or verify that the end result matches what the team had in mind.

If you know you'll need many Merge Requests to deliver a feature – for example, you
created a proof of concept and it is clear the feature will consist of 10+ Merge
Requests –, consider identifying reviewers and maintainers who possess the necessary
understanding of the feature (you share the context with them). Then direct all Merge
Requests to these reviewers. Having stable reviewer counterparts for multiple Merge
Requests with the same context improves efficiency.

Before the review, the author is requested to submit comments on the Merge Request diff
alerting the reviewer to anything important as well as for anything that demands further
explanation or attention. Examples of content that may warrant a comment could be:

- The addition of a linting rule;
- The addition of a dependency;
- Where not obvious, a link to the parent class or method;
- Any benchmarking performed to complement the change;
- Potentially insecure code.

If there are any projects, snippets, or other assets that are required for a reviewer to
validate the solution, ensure they have access to those assets before requesting review.

When assigning reviewers, it can be helpful to add a comment indicating which _type_ of
review you are looking for that reviewer. Explicitness around MR review types is
efficient for the MR author because they receive the type of review that they are
looking for and it is efficient for the MR reviewers because they immediately know which
type of review to provide.

Avoid:

- Adding `TODO` comments directly to the source code unless the reviewer requires you to
  do so. If `TODO` comments are added due to an actionable task, include a link to the
  relevant issue;
- Adding comments which only explain what the code is doing. If non-`TODO` comments are
  added, they should explain [why, not what][46];
- Requesting maintainer reviews of Merge Requests with failed tests. If the tests are
  failing and you have to request a review, ensure you leave a comment with an
  explanation.

This saves reviewers time and helps authors catch mistakes earlier.

##### Recommendations to Get Your Changes Merged Faster

1. Make sure to follow best practices:
   - Write efficient instructions, add screenshots, steps to validate etc.;
   - Follow the acceptance checklist for the MR template;
2. Follow the Galactipy patterns, even if you think there's a better way. Discussions
   often delay merging code. If a discussion is getting too long, consider following the
   documented approach or the maintainer's suggestion, then open a separate MR to
   implement your approach as part of our best practices and have the discussions there;
3. Consider splitting big MRs into smaller ones. Around 200 lines is a good threshold:
   - Smaller MRs reduce cognitive load for authors and reviewers;
   - Reviewers tend to pick up smaller MRs to review first (a large number of files can
     be scary);
   - Discussions on one particular part of the code will not block other parts of the
     code from being merged;
   - Smaller MRs are often simpler, and you can consider skipping the first review and
     sending directly to the maintainer, or skipping one of the suggested domains (e.g.,
     CI, GitHub features, GitLab features etc.);
   - :warning: Split MRs with caution: MRs that are too small increase the number of
     total reviews, which can cause the opposite effect;
4. Minimize the number of reviewers in a single MR.

##### Recommendations for Facilitating Reviews

Keep in mind that code review is a process that can take multiple iterations, and
reviewers may spot things later that they may not have seen the first time.

- The first reviewer of your code is you. Before you perform that first push of your
  shiny new branch, read through the entire diff. Does it make sense? Did you include
  something unrelated to the overall purpose of the changes? Did you forget to remove
  any debugging code?
- Write a detailed description as outlined in the [Merge Request guidelines][108]. Some
  reviewers may not be familiar with the product feature or area of the codebase.
  Thorough descriptions help all reviewers understand your request and test effectively;
- If you know your change depends on another being merged first, note it in the
  description and set a Merge Request dependency;
- Be grateful for the reviewer's suggestions ("Good call. I'll make that change.");
- Don't take it personally. The review is of the code, not of you;
- Explain [why][46] the code exists ("It's like that because of these reasons. Would it
  be more clear if I rename this class/file/method/variable?");
- Extract unrelated changes and refactoring tasks into future MRs/issues;
- Seek to understand the reviewer's perspective;
- Try to respond to every comment;
- The Merge Request author resolves only the threads they have fully addressed. If
  there's an open reply, an open thread, a suggestion, a question, or anything else, the
  thread should be left to be resolved by the reviewer;
- It should not be assumed that all feedback requires their recommended changes to be
  incorporated into the MR before it is merged. It is a judgment call by the MR author
  and the reviewer as to if this is required, or if a follow-up issue should be created
  to address the feedback in the future after the MR in question is merged;
- Request a new review from the reviewer once you are ready for another round of review.
  If you do not have the ability to request a review, `@` mention the reviewer instead.

#### The Responsibility of the Reviewer

All Galactipy contributors who choose to review and provide feedback on Merge Requests
have a responsibility to both the project and the individual making the contribution.
Reviews and feedback must be helpful, insightful, and geared towards improving the
contribution as opposed to simply blocking it. Do not expect to be able to block a Merge
Request from advancing simply because you say "No" without [giving an explanation][46].
Be open to having your mind changed. Be open to working with the contributor to make the
Merge Request better.

Reviews that are dismissive or disrespectful of the contributor or any other reviewers
are strictly counter to the [Code of Conduct][36].

When reviewing a Merge Request, the primary goals are for the codebase to improve and
for the person submitting the request to succeed. Even if a Merge Request does not land,
the submitters should come away from the experience feeling like their effort was not
wasted or unappreciated. Every Merge Request from a new contributor is an opportunity to
grow the community.

Review a bit at a time, do not overwhelm new contributors. It is tempting to
micro-optimize and make everything about relative performance, perfect grammar, or exact
style matches. Do not succumb to that temptation.

Focus first on the most significant aspects of the change:

- Does this change make sense for Galactipy?
- Does this change make Galactipy better, even if only incrementally?
- Are there clear bugs or larger scale issues that need attending to?
- Are the commit messages readable and correct?
- If it contains a breaking change is it clear enough?

Understand why the change is necessary (fixes a bug, improves the user experience,
refactors the existing code). Then:

- Try to be thorough in your reviews to reduce the number of iterations;
- Communicate which ideas you feel strongly about and those you don't;
- Identify ways to simplify the code while still solving the problem;
- Offer alternative implementations, but assume the author already considered them
  ("What do you think about using a custom validator here?");
- Seek to understand the author's perspective;
- Check out the branch, and test the changes locally. You can decide how much manual
  testing you want to perform. Your testing might result in opportunities to add
  automated tests;
- If you don't understand a piece of code, _say so_. There's a good chance someone else
  would be confused by it as well;
- Ensure the submitter is clear on what is required from them to address/resolve the
  suggestion;
- Ensure there are no open dependencies. Check linked issues for blockers. Clarify with
  the submitters if necessary. If blocked by one or more open MRs, set an
  [MR dependency][111];
- After a round of line notes, it can be helpful to post a summary note such as "Looks
  good to me", or "Just a couple things to address";
- Let the submitter know if changes are required following your review.

When changes are necessary, **request** them, do not _demand_ them, and do not assume
that the submitter already knows how to add a test or run a benchmark.

Specific performance optimization techniques, coding styles, and conventions change over
time. **The first impression you give to a new contributor never does.**

[Nits][112] (requests for small changes that are not essential) are fine, but try to
avoid stalling the Merge Request. Most nits can typically be fixed by the reviewer but
they can also be an opportunity for the contributor to learn a bit more about the
project.

It is always good to clearly indicate nits when you comment (e.g.,
`Nit: change foo() to bar(). But this is not blocking.`).

**Be aware of the person behind the change:** _how_ you communicate requests and reviews
in your feedback can have a significant impact on the success of the Merge Request. Yes,
we may land a particular change that makes Galactipy better, but the individual might
just not want to have anything to do with Galactipy ever again. The goal is not just
having good code, you should guide the author towards succeeding with their
contributions, whether the MR is approved or not in the end.

Lastly, **accept that there are different opinions about what belongs in Galactipy.** It
is not uncommon for contributors to suggest new features they feel would make Galactipy
better. These may or may not make sense to add, but as with all changes, be courteous in
how you communicate your stance on these. Comments that make the contributor feel like
they should have "known better" or ridiculed for even trying run counter to the
[Code of Conduct][36].

##### The Right Balance

One of the most difficult things during code review is finding the right balance in how
deep the reviewer can interfere with the code created by a submitter.

- Learning how to find the right balance takes time; that is why we have reviewers that
  become maintainers after some time spent on reviewing Merge Requests;
- Finding bugs is important, but thinking about good design is important as well.
  Building abstractions and good design is what makes it possible to hide complexity and
  makes future changes easier;
- Enforcing and improving [codestyle][8] should be primarily done through automation
  instead of review comments;
- Asking the submitter to change the design sometimes means the complete rewrite of the
  contributed code. It's usually a good idea to ask another maintainer or reviewer
  before doing it, but have the courage to do it when you believe it is important;
- In the interest of iteration, if your review suggestions are non-blocking changes, or
  personal preference – not a documented or agreed requirement –, consider approving the
  Merge Request before passing it back to the submitter. This allows them to implement
  your suggestions if they agree, or allows them to pass it onto the maintainer for
  review straight away. This can help reduce our overall time-to-merge;
- There is a difference in doing things right and doing things _right now_. Ideally, we
  should do the former, but in the real world we need the latter as well. A good example
  is a security fix which should be released as soon as possible. Asking the submitter
  to do the major refactoring in the Merge Request that is an urgent fix should be
  avoided;
- Doing things well today is usually better than doing something perfectly tomorrow.
  Shipping a kludge today is usually worse than doing something well tomorrow. When you
  are not able to find the right balance, ask other people about their opinion and use
  the [`seeking-contributors::opinion`][113] label.

#### The Responsibility of the Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for the overall health, quality, and consistency of the
Galactipy codebase.

Consequently, their reviews focus primarily on things like overall architecture, code
organization, separation of concerns, tests, DRYness, consistency, and readability.

Because a maintainer's job only depends on their knowledge of the overall Galactipy
codebase, and not that of any specific domain, they can review, approve, and merge MRs
from any type of changes.

Maintainers are the responsible individuals of assuring that the acceptance criteria of
a Merge Request are reasonably met. In general, quality is everyone's responsibility,
but maintainers are held responsible for ensuring that an MR meets those general quality
standards. This includes avoiding the creation of technical debt in follow-up issues.

Maintainers do their best to also review the specifics of the chosen solution before
merging, but as they are not necessarily domain experts, they may be poorly placed to do
so without an unreasonable investment of time. In those cases, they defer to the
judgment of the submitter and earlier reviewers, in favour of focusing on their primary
responsibilities.

If a developer who happens to also be a maintainer was involved in a Merge Request as a
reviewer, it is recommended that they are not also picked as the maintainer to
ultimately approve and merge it.

Maintainers should check before merging if the Merge Request is approved by the required
approvers. If still awaiting further approvals from others, `@` mention the submitter
and explain why in a comment.

### How to Behave among Other Contributors

Merge Requests, when worked under the concept of [proposals][108], turn into live and
open discussions. Whenever contributing to these discussions, please remind of the
following to write your comments:

- Be kind;
- Accept that many programming decisions are opinions. Discuss trade-offs, which you
  prefer, and reach a resolution quickly;
- Ask questions; don't make demands ("What do you think about naming this `user_id`?");
- Ask for clarification ("I didn't understand. Can you clarify?");
- Avoid selective ownership of code ("mine", "not mine", "yours");
- Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits ("dumb",
  "stupid"). Assume everyone is intelligent and well-meaning;
- Be explicit. Remember people don't always understand your intentions online;
- Be humble ("I'm not sure, let's look it up.");
- Don't use hyperbole ("always", "never", "endlessly", "nothing");
- Be careful about the use of sarcasm. Everything we do is public; what seems like
  good-natured ribbing to you and a long-time colleague might come off as mean and
  unwelcoming to a person new to the project;
- If you ask a question to a specific person, always start the comment by mentioning
  them; this ensures they see it if their notification level is set to "mentioned" and
  other people understand they don't have to respond.

### Fostering an Inviting Community

As a Galactipy contributor, your responsibilities are not supposed to be restricted to
code, commits and work items only. Software development is an act of collaboration, and
collaboration is inherently human in nature. Our desire is to build an outstanding
product, but it will be even more successful if it can be built with an ever growing
community of contributors.

However, the hard part of getting into open source for the first time isn't the
implementation of a feature, but
**figuring out how to actually contribute with changes**. That's why ensuring new
contributors can get started is as important as contributing itself. Open source
projects live and die by their communities, if we as contributors are not doing our job
of fostering communal interactions, maintaining the project might prove much harder in
the future.

There are two separate areas of action in which actions can be taken to achieve this
goal:

1. Preserve an orderly environment:
   - Keep the `CONTRIBUTING` file up to date and always reflective of the project's
     current policies and guidelines. Successful projects that reach larger audiences
     are able to do so through ease of access to knowledge surrounding them;
   - Make a conscious attempt to keep code and configuration [organised][114], with
     relevant implementation reasoning [documented][46] via the commit description;
   - Maintain and update Git hooks to check and enforce any project standards so people
     don't have the frustration of going back and forth on the Merge Request;
   - Maintain and update CI jobs to automate further development tasks and allow
     contributors to focus on delivering new features;
   - Be conscious of the [energy vampires][115] perturbing development and either propose
     [actions][39] for eliminating them or seek discussion and feedback via an
     [**Internal Improvement**][116] MR;
   - Keep the GitLab repository efficient by properly labelling work items and
     associating them with the relevant project milestone;
2. Become an advocate for new contributors:
   - Be overly conscious of [how to behave][99] when interacting with a user publishing
     their first request. The guidelines for [reviewers][117] also apply when
     communicating with Galactipy users in their requests;
   - Before jumping to resolve a request opened by a user, the best thing you can do is
     to open a sea of opportunities: **invite the author to solve the request together**
     and in the process grant them their first contribution to the project. You already
     know the drill, use the space to guide them on our ways and standards, empower them
     to understand how the project operates. You have [started small][118], so why not
     help someone else take this small first step?
   - Likewise, there are developments you could complete in less than 10 minutes.
     Why not turn them into [starter assignments][56]?

#### About Starter Assignments

We refer to our "Good First Issue" work items
as **starter assignments**,
a term we believe better aligns
with our goal
of fostering a vibrant community
around Galactipy.
The term "good first issue"
often feels generic
and commoditised,
offering little incentive for newcomers
to engage deeply with the project.
In contrast,
"starter assignments" emphasize action
and significance,
providing value
for both new contributors
and developers
who create these opportunities.

Through stater assignments,
we aim to:

1. Offer a compelling resource
   that encourages developers
   to begin contributing to Galactipy;
2. Enhance contributor onboarding
   by providing an alternative
   to simply pointing to documentation;
3. Encourage existing contributors
   to refine skills in
   technical writing,
   requirements specification,
   contextualisation
   and problem-solving organisation;
4. Elevate discussions
   around future developments
   by helping newcomers understand
   the project’s vision
   and enabling veterans
   to articulate ideas more clearly
   – ultimately leading to...
5. A broader pool of perspectives
   and proposals
   to amplify developments
   and help Galactipy thrive.

To achieve these goals,
it is essential
for current contributors
to identify opportunities
to turn ongoing work
into practical assignments
that new contributors can tackle
with ease.
Remember:
**designing starter assignments**
**is just as important**
**as developing new features**
– treat them
with the same care and dedication.

A few tips
to create high quality
starter assignments:

- Make them purpose-driven
  and connect them
  to greater goals of the project;
  good first issues exist
  solely for leaving a breadcrumb
  for the new contributor;
- Provide a clear path
  to the solution
  so someone else can implement it;
  you can leverage GitLab's
  feed-like functionality
  and work item hierarchy
  to slice the solution
  in smaller chunks;
- Make it as easy as possible;
  say exactly where changes need to go,
  recommend a good approach
  and tie it in
  to project's goals
  and development standards.

For new contributors
who have picked up a starter assignment,
your mentor most likely
has made their best effort
to ensure the delivery steps
are as clear as possible.
However, if you ever feel stuck
or confused,
don't hesitate to seek help.
Leverage [replies][119]
and [reactions][47]
to direct your questions
and work together
with your mentor
so you can see your contribution delivered.

If you are not getting replies
from your mentor,
mention `@all`
in your starter assignment
and someone from the team
will reach out to you.

## :reminder_ribbon: Other Ways to Contribute

You can contribute to Galactipy in additional ways, one does not need to know the inner
workings of the project to improve it! This section provides an overview on how users
outside the project development can aid the development team, as well as how to behave
and communicate to improve efficiency among the team and between the team and the
community.

Since running an open source project can get exceptionally busy, any new incoming
contact from outside the development team can require a contributor's attention to be
redirected from ongoing work for hours or days.

For this reason, we kindly ask users to make a conscious effort to evaluate the causes
for reaching the team and focus on matters that are useful, clear, easy to evaluate and
have already been refined to be brought to attention. This way everyone benefits from
faster communication and resolution.

### Contributing by Helping Other People

Inspired by [Typer's][120] welcoming community and their positive outlook on the effect
of [collective intelligence][121], we are committed to enabling an environment in which
such exponential interactions can take place. As such, one of the best ways people can
contribute to Galactipy is by helping others, either users like you who have reached the
members of the project with questions and requests or the development team itself.

The most direct way you can provide your help to others is to look for open
[Requests for Support][122] and try to answer other users' questions. In many cases you
might already know the answer to them!

Just remember, the most important point is: **try to be kind**. People come with their
frustrations and in many cases don't ask in the best way, but try as best as you can to
be kind. As mentioned earlier, we want this community to the welcoming.

At the same time, don't accept bullying or disrespectful behavior towards others. We
have to take care of each other. See the [Code of Conduct][36] for more details on how
we deal with these cases.

#### Orientation for Effectively Helping Others

Here is a general guide on how to help other users with their requests:

1. Understand the request:
   - Check if you can understand what is the **purpose** and use case of the person
     asking;
   - Then check if the request is **clear**;
   - In many cases the question asked is about an imaginary solution from the user, but
     there might be a **better** one. If you can understand the problem and use case
     better, you might be able to suggest a better **alternative solution**;
   - If you can't understand the question, ask for more details;
2. Reproduce the problem: for most of the cases relating to issues and questions in
   general, most likely there's something related to the person's original code. In many
   cases they will only copy a fragment of the code, but that's not enough to reproduce
   the problem;
   - You can ask them to provide a [minimal, reproducible example][123], that you can
     copy-paste and run locally to see the same error or behavior they are seeing, or to
     understand their use case better;
   - If you are feeling too generous, you can try to create an example like that
     yourself, just based on the description of the problem. Just have in mind that this
     might take a lot of time and it might be better to ask them to clarify the problem
     first;
3. Suggest solutions:
   - After being able to understand the question, you can give them a possible answer;
   - In many cases, it's better to understand their **underlying problem** or use case,
     because there might be a better way to solve it than what they are trying to do.

>>> [!tip] Tip: When Things are Difficult
When things are great, everything is easier, so that doesn't need much instructions. But
when things are difficult, here are some guidelines.

Try to find the good side. In general, if people are not being unfriendly, try to thank
their effort and interest, even if you disagree with the main subject, just thank them
for being interested in the project, or for having dedicated some time to try to do
something.

It's difficult to convey emotion in text, use emoji to help. :wink:

In many requests people bring their frustration and show it without filter, which can be
displayed through exaggerating, complaining, being entitled, etc. That's really not
nice, and when it happens, it lowers our priority to solve their problems. But still,
try to breathe, and be gentle with your answers.

Try to avoid using bitter sarcasm or potentially passive-aggressive comments. If
something is wrong, it's better to be direct (try to be gentle) than sarcastic.

Try to be as specific and objective as possible, avoid generalizations.
>>>

#### Commitment to Help

What consumes most of the time of the development team is actually answering questions
and solving problems. We end up not being able to add new features, fix bugs and review
Merge Requests as fast as we wanted because too much of the time is spent handling user
requests.

Also, this is on top of all the help provided by several community members that dedicate
a lot of their time to come here and aid others.

If more Galactipy users came to help others like them just a little bit more, it would
be much less effort for them.

That's why our templates for requests include a section calling authors to action with
improving the Galactipy ecosystem the best way they can. For all purposes, we believe
that contributions should be done by the person's own accord, demonstrating a
[bias for action][39] and fitting for their perceived capacity for helping.

Therefore, we have implemented a **Commitment to Help** modus operandi, kindly asking
issue authors to engage further and help lessen demand overall. If for every new request
that comes there is extra action from its author to help with another project demand, we
strengthen our community and improve, bit by bit, every aspect of Galactipy:
communication, agility, organization, aggregated value and more!

If you have opened or are about to open a Request for Support, we would be extremely
grateful if you could pick one of the options from the list provided in the template to
commit with additional help for the project.

We thank you in advance for your kindness and dedication!

### Contributing through User Requests

If you are simply having trouble using Galactipy, go through the [`README`][16] file and
links directing to support content first, rather than consider filing a request.

Galactipy implements three types of requests for users through [Issue Templates][124]:

- **Requests for Correction**;
- **Requests for Improvement**;
- **Requests for Support**.

All three templates provide a brief summary explaining their purpose, as well as a handy
information on where to best use them. They contain structured sections with HTML
comments to guide you further with opening your request correctly, please follow them as
closely as possible. If any instruction is not clear, please raise your concern so we
can help and improve them if applicable.

>>> [!note]
A fourth template, **Internal Work Item**, is available to contributors for specific
cases regarding project development. This should not be used if you do not have
Developer status.
>>>

**Always use one of the templates for opening requests!** By taking a single look at its
type and the structured sections filled by the author, we can provide faster feedback on
your request. We will kindly ask you to edit the issue with the appropriate template if
one is not used or used incorrectly.

Here are a few general tips when opening any kind of request to enhance your chances of
a quick response:

- Follow the template sections so team members can view your structured line of thought
  and actions leading up to your request;
- Provide **context**: explaining the conditions which led you to open your request
  facilitates our comprehension of your perspective and helps creating empathy with your
  case;
- **Avoid duplication** by making a real effort to determine whether your request has
  not been already made by another user before using the [Search][125] feature for all
  items in the Issue Tracker;
- It is also important to avoid requests that describe too much. Each should be
  documented in its own request. It's often unavoidable that requests can be complex,
  especially with big feature requests. Adding a lot of detail to a request is great,
  but when a complex one can be separated into multiple requests, that makes them easier
  to resolve. **One request per request**;
- **Titles are important!** Keep your titles short and descriptive. Don't try to cram
  every bit of information in the title. More importantly, titles should also be
  **compelling**. When someone reads your request, they should want to work on it. The
  title sells the request. Don't sacrifice allure for brevity;
  - A good rule of thumb is that a title should be descriptive enough that someone
    looking back at it later will understand what the purpose of the issue was and how
    it fits into the larger context;
  - To make your request more descriptive, avoid vague titles like "update files" or
    "fix issue." Instead, specify what the request comprises of;
- Properly format your messages. Help the reader focus on what matters and understand
  the structure of your message. [GitLab Flavoured Markdown][126] has a simple but
  effective syntax, consider taking a look before writing your request;
- **Good requests are also professional development.** Many companies have a
  remote-first style where most discussions happen asynchronously. We truly believe that
  approaching your request with this mindset can also help you further become a better
  developer down the line.

#### Specific Guidelines for Requests for Support

If Galactipy is not working correctly for you, most likely it is a simple configuration
issue. Try running Cookiecutter again paying attention to the parameters you have
provided.

If you are still having difficulty generating your project as desired, open an
[RFS][127] and provide your `cookiecutter-config-file.yml` if applicable.

Only open a Request for Correction if you have clearly identified an unexpected
behaviour with template generation that needs to be addressed. Otherwise, if details are
not clear, prefer sticking to the Request for Support as the means to reach the team.

#### Specific Guidelines for Requests for Improvement

Requests for Improvement are used when users feel a need for development related to
features provided by Galactipy, either existent or yet-to-be-implemented. They are very
welcome, as they help us engage with the community on a more proactive level and work to
deliver a solution of aggregated value to our users.

But before opening an [RFI][128], take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with
the scope and [aims][24] of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong case to
convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much
detail and context as possible.

If you are requesting an entirely new feature to be added to the Galactipy toolset,
please consider answering the following prospective questions to make your case
stronger:

- Is the feature or service widely known, used and accepted?
- Could your desired feature be delivered by one of the tools already provided by
  Galactipy?
- Is this feature well documented to be studied by people unfamiliar with it to use?
- Is this feature easy to use once it is implemented?
- Does this feature require just additional files to be included in projects generated
  by Galactipy? Or does it require additional configuration, either in those files or
  external services? The less configuration needed for the feature to work on a
  generated project from the start the more chances it will have to be eventually added;
- How does this feature help speeding development and delivery of other projects besides
  yours?
- What is the level of maintenance that will be needed once this feature is integrated
  into Galactipy?

Also, why not take this opportunity to [become a contributor][39]? After all, the most
effective way to make a contribution is to make one [that comes from yourself][34].

#### Specific Guidelines for Requests for Correction

Requests for Correction are used to track unexpected behaviour from template generation,
namely bugs.

A bug is a **demonstrable** problem that is caused by the code in the repository.

Guidelines for [RFCs][129]:

- Use the [issue search][130] to check if a request has already been reported;
- Check if the issue has been fixed by trying to reproduce it using the latest version
  of Galactipy;
- **Isolate the problem:** create a test case to demonstrate your issue. Provide either
  a repository, [gist][131]/[snippet][132] or code sample to demonstrate you problem.

We kindly ask applicants to be available for follow-up questions to clarify their
reports if more information is needed. A good RFC should include sufficient information
to help developers identify the issue’s underlying cause. While the nature of errors can
be diverse and thus challenging for users to report with full context, providing the
information below is much valuable to accelerate the process:

- What is your environment?
  - What OS are you using?
  - How did you install Cookiecutter?
  - Which version of Galactipy are you using?
- What steps will reproduce the issue?
  - What are the parameters used during project generation? You can provide those
    through the `cookiecutter-config-file.yml`;
  - At which point specifically did your error occur during your journey? At project
    generation? Using one of the tools/services provided with Galactipy projects?
  - Did you address any `UPDATEME` tags that could be related to the tool/service in
    question? What did you do?
- Can you provide error logs or tracebacks to further detail the issue? Tools like
  [`reprexpy`][133] can assist you in providing more technical detail if you are not
  able to;
- Do you have any visual evidence to share for further investigation?

These details will help people to fix any potential issues. It is important to note that
**all** reports are valuable, even if they are not perfectly detailed.

>>> [!warning]
**Avoid overloading with extraneous details.** RFCs are the type of request that most
need attention and careful examination by the development team, since a bug can turn
Galactipy entirely unusable. Focus on objective facts directly related to the bug and
kindly perform your due diligence as much as possible before bringing it to us,
contextualising your research and findings to avoid rework by the development team.
>>>

### Contributing by Reviewing Changes

Changes to Galactipy source code are proposed, reviewed and committed via
[GitLab Merge Requests][3]. Anyone can view and comment on active changes here.
Participating in code reviews helps you understand our processes and explore different
domains of the project. Contribute by reviewing proposed changes and identifying
potential improvements – as simple as typos or styling inconsistencies.

As a reviewer, your job is not to make sure that the code is what you would have written
– **because it will not be**. Your job as a reviewer of a change is to make sure that
the change as written by its submitter is correct.

Try to think of edge cases when testing or evaluating the code, double check the test
coverage. But do not frown if you merged the Merge Request and something broke after
all. This is the learning path to avoiding this mistake on the next attempt. Not doing
a review in the first place will not move you forward either.

To get you quickstarted on reviewing MRs for Galactipy, here are a few tips that may
help overcoming the paralysis of [taking action][39]:

- Verify that the appropriate tests have been added. When testing a feature or change,
  check out the code tests at least the happy paths according to the specification of
  the MR;
- See if documentation has been added for the change in question. Smaller documentation
  changes should be added along with the core changes of the proposal;
- Changes should be **readable**, that is, you as a reviewer should be able to
  understand the nature of the changes without additional explanations outside the
  changes; however, if something is not clear, we encourage you to ask for
  clarification as it might indicate the need for further changes for full compliance
  before a maintainer can complete the MR;
- You should not rush through a code review, but also, you need to do it promptly. Your
  colleagues are waiting for you.

We strongly encourage you to take further readings on the [Review Process][134], the
[Responsibilities of the Reviewer][117] and [general communication guidelines][99] to get
more detail on how to make the most out of your contributions as a reviewer. We
appreciate your commitment beforehand!

### Contributing with Documentation Changes

Currently, the documentation surrounding Galactipy, including features, how to use,
options and reference material are found directly in the project [`README`][16] file.

Since Galactipy is a Cookiecutter template, there is no API being maintained and thus
there is no need for a comprehensive and detailed documentation. Galactipy's
documentation encompasses the following topics:

- Features provided by Galactipy templates;
- Basic steps to get started with projects generated by Galactipy;
- A list of next actions to take for full project setup that require external services;
- Reference material for useful Python libraries, tips for project management and links
  to useful articles and guides for further reading.

You can propose changes and additions to the documentation by editing the `README` file
and [opening a Merge Request][31] to integrate your changes to the project.

The current state of the "documentation" stems from Galactipy's origins as a fork of
`python-package-template`. The %10 milestone is currently anticipated to better
structure relevant information and reduce clutter on the `README` file. We welcome any
contributor willing to help us make this transition.

### Contributing to Roadmap Maintenance

The project roadmap is maintained through [GitLab Milestones][24]. It provides an
overview of the medium and long-term priorities of Galactipy as a project, whether they
impact end-users or not.

Contributors and maintainers are responsible for managing the roadmap. However, anyone
can support the project by ensuring alignment with this roadmap, identifying
opportunities that influences the project's most impactful deliverables and
communicating them to the development team:

- Getting familiar with our milestones and associated items, and then opening additional
  [**Requests for Improvement**][128] that pertain to existing milestones;
- Commenting on [issues without associated milestones][135] and suggesting what relevant
  developments could they be associated with for the development team to evaluate;
- Linking issues and Merge Requests that provide combined effort towards a single goal
  of the project. If two or more development streams can be delivered with the same
  solution, we can generate increased aggregated value;
- Becoming a [contributor][4] to act on existing milestones, propose new developments
  not yet mapped or recommend [changes to the roadmap itself][136].
