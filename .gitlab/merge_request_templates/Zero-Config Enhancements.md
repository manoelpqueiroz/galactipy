# :school_satchel: Zero-Config Enhancement

>>> [!note] :bulb: Improves initial file configuration and reduces user friction
This template should be used to propose and discuss changes to the default configuration provided by Galactipy for users.

:ok: **Types of changes to be proposed with this template:** file disposition, pre-configuration of values in existing tools, Invoke tasks for automating project setup, tool maintenance which directly reduces setup time for users

:no_good: **What this type of proposal does not stand for:**

- Updates to existing tools which do not affect user experience at the project startup;
- Proposals for new tools and services;
- Modifications to configuration outside `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}`.
>>>
