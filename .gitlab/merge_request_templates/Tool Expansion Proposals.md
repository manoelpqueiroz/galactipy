# :rocket: Tool Expansion Proposal

>>> [!note] :bulb: To provide additional tools for Galactipy-generated projects
This template should be used to propose and discuss the inclusion of new tools and integrated solutions to the pool of features provided by Galactipy templates to user projects.

:ok: **Types of changes to be proposed with this template:** cutting-edge tools, service integrations, non-existing features, either as a complete or an incremental development

:no_good: **What this type of proposal does not stand for:**

- Updates to existing tools;
- Proposals to replace existing tools with alternatives;
- Tools for development of Galactipy itself.
