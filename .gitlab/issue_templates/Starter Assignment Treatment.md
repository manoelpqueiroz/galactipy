# :notepad_spiral: Starter Assignment Treatment

>>> [!caution]
**This template should be used to write delivery steps for `starter-assignment` issues or tasks.**

:compass: For contributors writing the work item's scope:

- Provide clear steps for resolution, following the [`CONTRIBUTING`][1] guidelines. Use the HTML comments to orient yourself with the more relevant topics;
- Be available to follow up with further guidance once a new contributor picks this work item. Ensure issue notifications are on for you after creating this item;
- Check the [Responsibilities of the Reviewer][2] as they provide useful information to better handle the development cycle for starter assignments;
- Remember your intentions and conceived solution when you wrote this item's delivery steps may not always be [clear][3] to someone unfamiliar with the project;
- Use this opportunity to teach, learn and be a bridge to welcome people to our community.

:raising_hand: For newcomers picking this work item as their first contribution:

- Make sure to read the [`CONTRIBUTING`][4] guide and the [`CODE OF CONDUCT`][5] to become familiar with our procedures before you start working on the solution. If you have any questions about unclear guidelines, leave a comment so an active contributor can clarify them;
- Raise your hand whenever you feel stuck. While the team has put a lot of effort to make your contribution the most straightforward possible, it is always hard to account for all possible [nuances][3] any communication brings, let alone online interactions;
- Understand our [submission guidelines][6] before opening a Merge Request to increase the chances of your changes being merged. Access your mentor for guidance;
- Make sure to [track progress][7] consistently to keep yourself and your mentor updated on your contribution's status. Keep communication with your mentor and development updates flowing.

## :microphone2: Overview

This is a starter assignment designed to help you get familiar with contributing to Galactipy. By completing this task, you'll be able to make your first contribution to the project and set yourself up for future success.

Please read carefully all the sections below. They have been provided by an active contributor to the project, aiming to be as easily accessible as possible for you to pick the work up.

If you feel interested in taking on this challenge, please state so by commenting on this thread, and if you have any questions, the team will be pleased to answer them! :wink:

## :sos: Problem Statement

<!--
  Provide:

  - A general description of what the new contributor will deliver;
  - The reasons that led to this being incorporated in the development stream;
  - The reasons why this has been officialised as a starter assignment, especially if you can explain how this relates to more complex developments the new contributor might be able to tackle in the future if the starter assignment is properly delivered.
-->

## :footprints: Delivery Steps

<!--
  Provide how the new contributor will deliver the solution.

  Our recommended approach is to break the development in tasks, which will contain further detail on each building block, and then list them in the order the new contributor should deliver them here, like a recipe.

  You are free to choose how to approach writing this section, of course, but strive to make it clear so the new contributor can follow it without getting lost.
-->

### Success Criteria

<!-- The delivery steps explain HOW the solution will be delivered, but you should also brief the new contributor on WHAT will make their changes proner to being merged. -->

## :books: Guidance and Resources

<!--
  If you have any tips or caveats that will further help the new contributor succeed without hiccups along the way, feel free to bring your experience as a more seasoned developer to the table.

  Additionaly, provide links to any useful resources like documentation of other libraries and blog posts that might prove insightful for the new contributor during their work.
-->

## :index_pointing_at_the_viewer: What We Need from You

<!-- OPTIONAL
  Use this section to optionally provide any orientation on behaviour, attitude and set expectations on commitment and delivery clear.
-->

## :park: Building from Here

<!-- OPTIONAL
  Boost this starter assignment's appeal and reach by providing the new contributor with additional context, like:

  - How this delivery will impact medium and long-term development;
  - Which milestones will be closer to being delivered as a result;
  - What possible next challenges the contributor could engage with if this starter assignment is completed.

  Everything is an opportunity to turn an interested newcomer into a valuable contributor to the project.
-->
