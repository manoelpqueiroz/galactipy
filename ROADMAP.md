# :map: Galactipy Roadmap

## About Galactipy

Galactipy is a [Cookiecutter][1] template for generating boilerplate files and
creating Python software, especially CLI applications. By running Cookiecutter, users
can have an initial set of files to jumpstart their project development, reducing the
need for tool and service setup to a bare minimum.

### Project Mission

Provide a comprehensive set of files for developers to use with their newly created
projects, encompassing configuration files, developer productivity tools and
ready-to-use scripts for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, reducing
overhead and accelerating actual development of new software.

### How to Get Involved

This file is mainly used for informational purposes. If you wish to know how to get
involved with Galactipy, check out the [`CONTRIBUTING`][2] file, where you can get
acquainted with the many ways of helping the project.

## About this Document

This document provides a summary of the Galactipy [GitLab Milestones][3] that serves
as the up-to-date description of items that are in the project's release pipeline. Most
items are gathered from the community or include a feedback loop with the community.
This should serve as a reference point for Galactipy users and contributors to
understand where the project is heading, and help determine if a contribution could be
conflicting with a longer term plan.

### How to Help

Discussion on the roadmap takes place via Merge Requests and discussions on the
project's repository over GitLab. Please check the sections on [Merge Requests][4]
and [Roadmap Maintenance][5] of the `CONTRIBUTING` file for further clarification on
how to proceed if you believe a discussion surrounding the project's direction should
take place, whether you want to provide suggestions or just feedback to an item in the
roadmap.

Please review the roadmap to avoid potential duplicated effort.

## Roadmap History

The following table includes the current roadmap for Galactipy for summarisation
and discussion purposes only. Dates provided here are gross estimations and might be
outdated, please refer to each milestone for more accurate information.

Priorities and requirements change based on community feedback, roadblocks encountered,
community contributions etc. If you depend on a specific item, check if it is mapped for
development through the most appropriate milestone. If not, open a
[**Request for Improvement**][6] through the Issue Tracker. We will try our best
to bring updated status information.

You can also help us deliver that feature by contributing directly to
Galactipy, we are always looking for contributors that will help us reduce technical,
automation, and documentation debt. If you don't know where to start, read the
[guidelines][7] for developers to situate yourself first and get to know how we
work as a team. If you still have any questions, open a Request for Support via the
[Issue Tracker][8] so the team can help with clarifications.
